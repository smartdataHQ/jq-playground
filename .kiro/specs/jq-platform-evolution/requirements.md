# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines high-value, high-cost platform evolution features for the jq transformation editor. These are long-term investments that require significant development resources but transform the tool from a simple editor into a comprehensive data transformation and collaboration platform suitable for enterprise use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Query Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to create and run automated tests for my jq queries, so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions when modifying complex transformations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a query THEN I SHALL be able to define test cases with expected inputs and outputs
2. WHEN I run tests THEN the system SHALL execute all test cases and report pass/fail status
3. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL show detailed diff between expected and actual results
4. WHEN I modify a query THEN the system SHALL automatically run related tests and warn of failures
5. WHEN I save a query THEN the system SHALL require at least one passing test case
6. IF I have multiple related queries THEN I SHALL be able to create integration tests across the pipeline

### Requirement 2: Advanced Performance Profiling & Optimization

**User Story:** As an enterprise user processing large datasets, I want detailed performance analysis and automatic optimization suggestions, so that I can handle production-scale data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I process large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide memory usage monitoring and optimization suggestions
2. WHEN a query is inefficient THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative approaches with performance comparisons
3. WHEN I enable streaming mode THEN the system SHALL process data in chunks without loading everything into memory
4. WHEN queries are complex THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and suggest parallelization opportunities
5. WHEN I work with nested data THEN the system SHALL optimize field access patterns automatically
6. IF memory usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the situation with partial results

### Requirement 3: Collaborative Features & Team Workflows

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want my team to collaborate on jq queries with sharing, commenting, and review workflows, so that we can maintain quality and share knowledge across the organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a query THEN I SHALL be able to share it with team members via secure links
2. WHEN reviewing shared queries THEN team members SHALL be able to add comments and suggestions
3. WHEN a query is modified THEN the system SHALL track changes and allow reverting to previous versions
4. WHEN queries are business-critical THEN I SHALL be able to require peer review before deployment
5. WHEN team members create useful patterns THEN they SHALL be automatically added to the team library
6. IF conflicts arise in collaborative editing THEN the system SHALL provide merge conflict resolution tools

### Requirement 4: Enterprise API Integration & Data Connectors

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want to connect directly to various data sources and APIs, so that I can create end-to-end data transformation pipelines without manual data export/import steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure a database connection THEN the system SHALL securely connect and allow querying with jq transformations
2. WHEN I connect to REST APIs THEN the system SHALL handle authentication, pagination, and rate limiting automatically
3. WHEN I set up data pipelines THEN the system SHALL support scheduling and automated execution
4. WHEN data sources change THEN the system SHALL detect schema changes and suggest query updates
5. WHEN processing real-time data THEN the system SHALL support streaming transformations with low latency
6. IF external systems are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallback and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 5: Advanced Export & Report Generation

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to generate formatted reports and export data in various formats directly from my jq transformations, so that I can deliver insights without additional manual formatting steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a transformation THEN I SHALL be able to export results in multiple formats (Excel, PDF, CSV, XML)
2. WHEN generating reports THEN I SHALL be able to apply templates with charts, tables, and formatted layouts
3. WHEN creating dashboards THEN the system SHALL support embedding live query results with automatic refresh
4. WHEN sharing results THEN I SHALL be able to create interactive reports that allow parameter modification
5. WHEN scheduling reports THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and distribute them to stakeholders
6. IF report generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and retry options

### Requirement 6: Machine Learning Integration & Smart Suggestions

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the system to learn from my query patterns and suggest optimizations or alternative approaches, so that I can continuously improve my data transformation efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write queries frequently THEN the system SHALL learn my patterns and suggest similar transformations for new data
2. WHEN I work with unfamiliar data structures THEN the system SHALL suggest common transformation patterns based on data characteristics
3. WHEN my queries are inefficient THEN the system SHALL use ML to suggest performance improvements
4. WHEN I encounter errors THEN the system SHALL suggest fixes based on successful patterns from similar queries
5. WHEN exploring new datasets THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest interesting insights and transformations
6. IF the system makes suggestions THEN it SHALL explain the reasoning and confidence level

### Requirement 7: Enterprise Security & Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want comprehensive audit trails, access controls, and compliance features, so that the platform meets enterprise security requirements for handling sensitive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN all actions SHALL be logged with timestamps, user identity, and data accessed
2. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL support field-level encryption and masking
3. WHEN queries access personal data THEN the system SHALL enforce data governance policies automatically
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate data classification and handling restrictions
5. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN all connections SHALL use enterprise-grade security protocols
6. IF compliance violations are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately alert administrators and block the action

### Requirement 8: Advanced Workflow Automation

**User Story:** As a data operations manager, I want to create automated workflows that chain multiple transformations and handle complex business logic, so that I can build sophisticated data processing pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create workflows THEN I SHALL be able to chain multiple jq transformations with conditional logic
2. WHEN workflows encounter errors THEN the system SHALL support retry logic, error handling, and alerting
3. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN workflows SHALL automatically apply correction rules or flag for review
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL trigger downstream processes or notifications
5. WHEN monitoring workflows THEN I SHALL have real-time visibility into execution status and performance metrics
6. IF workflows need modification THEN the system SHALL support versioning and rollback capabilities
