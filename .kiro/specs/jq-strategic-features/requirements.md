# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines medium-value, medium-cost strategic improvements to the jq transformation editor. These features require moderate development effort but provide significant competitive advantages and user experience improvements that position the tool as a professional-grade data transformation platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Live Preview with Intermediate Results

**User Story:** As a jq user building complex queries, I want to see intermediate results at each step of my transformation pipeline, so that I can debug and understand how my query processes the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write a multi-step jq query with pipes THEN the system SHALL show expandable sections for each pipeline stage
2. WHEN I click on a pipeline stage THEN the system SHALL display the intermediate result at that point
3. WHEN I modify part of a query THEN the system SHALL update only the affected pipeline stages and downstream results
4. WHEN an error occurs in a pipeline stage THEN the system SHALL highlight the failing stage and show the error context
5. IF a pipeline stage produces large results THEN the system SHALL show a summary with option to expand full results
6. WHEN I hover over a pipeline operator (|) THEN the system SHALL show a preview tooltip of the data at that point

### Requirement 2: Visual Query Builder Interface

**User Story:** As a non-technical user or jq beginner, I want to build queries using a visual interface with drag-and-drop operations, so that I can create transformations without learning jq syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch to visual mode THEN the system SHALL display a flowchart-style query builder
2. WHEN I drag a field from the JSON viewer THEN I SHALL be able to drop it onto operation blocks (filter, map, select)
3. WHEN I connect operation blocks THEN the system SHALL automatically generate the corresponding jq syntax
4. WHEN I modify the visual query THEN the system SHALL update the text query in real-time
5. WHEN I edit the text query THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation if possible
6. IF the text query is too complex for visual representation THEN the system SHALL show a "text-only" indicator

### Requirement 3: Advanced Autocomplete with Context

**User Story:** As a jq user, I want intelligent autocomplete that understands data types and context, so that I get relevant suggestions based on what I'm actually working with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm filtering an array of objects THEN the system SHALL suggest object fields and appropriate comparison operators
2. WHEN I'm working with string fields THEN the system SHALL suggest string functions (contains, startswith, split, etc.)
3. WHEN I'm working with numeric fields THEN the system SHALL suggest math operations and aggregation functions
4. WHEN I type a function name THEN the system SHALL show parameter hints with expected types
5. WHEN I'm inside a select() function THEN the system SHALL prioritize boolean operations and comparisons
6. IF I'm working with date strings THEN the system SHALL suggest date parsing and formatting functions

### Requirement 4: Result Comparison & Diff View

**User Story:** As a jq user iterating on queries, I want to compare results between different query versions, so that I can understand the impact of my changes and optimize my transformations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify a query THEN the system SHALL offer to show a diff between old and new results
2. WHEN I enable diff mode THEN the system SHALL highlight added, removed, and modified elements in the output
3. WHEN I have multiple query versions THEN I SHALL be able to select any two for comparison
4. WHEN comparing results THEN the system SHALL show statistics (items added/removed/changed)
5. WHEN results are large THEN the system SHALL provide a summary diff with option to explore details
6. IF results have different structures THEN the system SHALL intelligently align comparable elements

### Requirement 5: Multi-tab Workspace

**User Story:** As a jq user working on multiple related transformations, I want to manage multiple queries in tabs, so that I can work on different aspects of my data processing pipeline simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "New Tab" THEN the system SHALL create a new workspace with independent JSON input and jq query
2. WHEN I have multiple tabs THEN each SHALL maintain its own state (input, query, output, history)
3. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve the cursor position and editor state
4. WHEN I close a tab with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL prompt to save or discard changes
5. WHEN I have many tabs open THEN the system SHALL provide tab scrolling and a tab overview menu
6. IF I drag a tab THEN I SHALL be able to reorder tabs or detach them to separate windows

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Data Import & Processing

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to import data from various sources and formats, so that I can work with real-world data without manual conversion steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I drag a CSV file into the input area THEN the system SHALL convert it to JSON automatically
2. WHEN I paste XML data THEN the system SHALL offer to convert it to JSON format
3. WHEN I import large files THEN the system SHALL show progress and allow cancellation
4. WHEN I connect to an API endpoint THEN the system SHALL fetch data and handle authentication
5. WHEN data has inconsistent structure THEN the system SHALL provide normalization options
6. IF imported data is too large THEN the system SHALL offer sampling options for testing queries

### Requirement 7: Query Performance Analysis

**User Story:** As a jq user working with large datasets, I want to understand query performance characteristics, so that I can optimize my transformations for better efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute a query THEN the system SHALL display execution time and memory usage
2. WHEN a query is slow THEN the system SHALL suggest optimization techniques
3. WHEN I enable profiling mode THEN the system SHALL show time spent in each pipeline stage
4. WHEN working with large arrays THEN the system SHALL warn about potentially expensive operations
5. WHEN I compare query versions THEN the system SHALL show performance differences
6. IF a query times out THEN the system SHALL suggest breaking it into smaller steps
