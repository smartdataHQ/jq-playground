# Server Status Report

## Summary
The server is currently **not running**. All checks confirm that there is no active server process on port 3001.

## Verification Steps Performed

1. **Process Search**
   - Searched for processes matching "node server.js"
   - Searched for all Node.js processes
   - No server process was found

2. **Port Check**
   - Checked for any process listening on port 3001 using `lsof -i :3001`
   - No process was found using this port

3. **Port Binding Test**
   - Successfully bound a test server to port 3001
   - This confirms the port is available and not in use

## Conclusion

The server has been successfully stopped. No further action is required to fulfill the request "stop the server".

If you need to start the server again, you can use one of the following commands:
- `cd server && npm run dev` (for development with auto-restart)
- `cd server && npm start` (for production)
- `cd server && node server.js` (direct start)
